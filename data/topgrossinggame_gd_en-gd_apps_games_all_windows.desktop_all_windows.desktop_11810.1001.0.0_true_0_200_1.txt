The soldier in this game has a story as well, except that it’s incomplete. The soldier begins to tell the tale, but does not end it.\r\n\r\nThis Game draw parallels to our familiar stories of 'One Thousand And One Nights', The Arabian Nights from the perspective of the soldier. Play this Game and Stretch your mind. Fast forward to the Past for Magic, Romance and History. The more you play, the more you will be amazed. Your victory is to capture all the magic and mystery that are the Arabian Nights.\r\n\r\nTHE STORY WITHIN A STORY:\r\nThe story is of a woman, Sharazad, who marries a King. The King's custom is to spend one night with a woman and execute her in the morning. To avoid this, Sharazad tells him tales of Ali Baba, Aladdin and Sinbad, but leaves part of it unfinished.The King, curious about how the story ends, is thus forced to postpone her execution in order to hear the conclusion. The next night, as soon as she finishes the tale, she begins and only begins a new one, and the King, eager to hear the conclusion, postpones her execution once again until the King finally spares her life. So it goes on for 1,001 nights, The Arabian Nights.\r\n\r\nSOLDIER TURNED WORRIER:\r\nThis is your journey to the past. You are the worrier of the ‘Arabian Nights’. You are a very different sort of Ali Baba, Aladdin and Sinbad. You are the Legend REBORN. You are an iconic figure in the King’s army and you are honored with the Medal of Courage. You are going to be called on to take care of the most nasty situations. The King realized that assault from the sea was always a commando like operation which required special training, bold leadership, and an aggressive spirit. You have gained a lot of the valuable combat experience in Arabian battles. You take on this legendary character of the soldier that turned into a worrier and have to finish the story. You can turn around the remaining story whenever you want.\r\n\r\nACTION PLAY:\r\n- This is a 6-Axis controls game in Full HD and 3D Graphics.\r\n- Your Weapon is the \"Six Pack\" Automatic Machine Gun.\r\n- Your Six Barreled MG can fire 4000 rounds of explosives per minute.\r\n- You have the support of Enemy Detecting Radar that helps you to navigate the battlefield.\r\n- The Doppler Radar figures out the distance at which your enemies are moving.\r\n- The Radar also uses Infrared Radiation patterns to point out the positions of the enemy troops.\r\n\r\nFor Windows Tablet:\r\n\r\n- You can move left, right, forward, reverse using the on screen touch pad.\r\n- The double touch feature provides 3D camera view in all directions.\r\n- You can touch and swipe your fingers of both hands at the same time for smooth rotations.\r\n- The Gun Fire Control System (GFCS) is shown on the lower right side of the touch screen.\r\n- You can use your right hand thumb to tap on the screen to fire the machine gun.\r\n\r\nFor Windows PC:\r\n\r\n- Use Mouse Cursor For Rotation \r\n- Use left Control Or Left Mouse button for auto fire\r\n- Use Arrow keys for movement\r\n\r\nYou Guys, Good Luck Tonight, And Remember Have Fun With It.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDL1SC","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Tales of Middleport","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8719.9007199266414088.58817be4-ec68-4a0f-adf6-e23402f11edb.d48a68ec-f77f-418c-93d4-bd8f7ca98191","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#2b4171","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1395.9007199266414088.a2b3452e-35c3-4664-8722-06f397e4a207.a1a333e7-0839-46eb-8a27-a6d8fc3ec57a","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#2b4171","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["GogiiGames.TalesofMiddleport_h0jt470c3ph82"],"ContentIds":["80d472c0-0d84-1d34-ce47-d080079cd82c"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"A darkness has fallen over the once-sleepy seaside town of Middleport, and townspeople are mysteriously disappearing at an alarming rate!

Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. \r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\n•Available in the following languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Chinese\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://driftmania2.com  \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com   \r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJCJR","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Fate of the Pharaoh","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32389.9007199266251700.0e4ba0df-5537-4387-921b-ba0cfbab38d3.9675d4cc-ef51-4d42-b244-5d9b54930cc1","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#185D94","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48570.9007199266251700.4153983c-052b-455a-8e03-6eb413bf3da5.35ceba5b-0c2d-42f8-a64f-95d178ad45e4","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#185D94","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64563.9007199266251700.f6bce5e4-9094-4eb5-8430-c75933d4cfb7.4ee5393a-4f17-42d5-905f-c6a8a3e77d9c","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2631.9007199266251700.f6bce5e4-9094-4eb5-8430-c75933d4cfb7.79b2545b-8b62-4778-b2fa-276b5de7b5eb","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13620.9007199266251700.f6bce5e4-9094-4eb5-8430-c75933d4cfb7.8f4d1fbe-acac-4720-b68f-00deb0e52f02","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#185D94","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["CateiaGames.FateofthePharaoh_mmwabm93ypyqr"],"ContentIds":["bb1eca3e-c711-b7ed-74b9-743df78debf6","0b4d1e5c-03f2-c7e7-5c8e-d9d267e5f20f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Build your glorious Egyptian towns and expand your realm in glory and prosper!\r\n\r\nConstruct your own mighty Egyptian empire and take control of the land in Fate of the Pharaoh!

10!\r\n\r\nSolitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day. Complete enough Daily Challenges in a month to earn badges and compete with your friends.\r\n\r\nStar Club\r\nEven more challenges arranged in collections and packs you can unlock by earning stars.\r\n\r\nChoose Your Theme\r\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection features several beautiful themes, from the simplicity of \"Classic\" to the serenity of an Aquarium that comes to life before you while you play. You can even create custom themes from your own photos!\r\n\r\nXbox Live Integration\r\nSign in with your Microsoft account to earn achievements, compete with your friends on the leaderboards, and track your personal gameplay statistics. If you sign in with a Microsoft account, your progress is stored in the cloud so you can play the game on any device without missing a beat!\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH58QD4","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Survivors: The Quest","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8457.13510798886905875.f0979f22-e1ad-477a-8282-8ebd05bdb864.828018f8-d9ed-4068-8c94-ed1f8bfc1db6","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58920.13510798886905875.3405c710-57a8-491c-b8de-ce1bb9d28700.59025dd4-f54b-42fc-9d67-b027b311418d","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47319.13510798886905875.ee3ea1ff-84fd-4a4c-88d9-062182e15fe5.a8839d14-0c30-49c4-8ae4-253796c5b445","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19541.13510798886905875.67b77e49-ba28-4fac-a9f4-bc493c5f1c60.f39ebdd0-12c2-4433-9aa5-f624d91903a3","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2923.13510798886905875.5a52b57f-273d-4493-93c1-b58fa975a866.d17237d9-7d0d-4a7c-98a5-b081e9010071","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44529.13510798886905875.9ea75237-ea6e-4ab4-ab99-e096b7b4c2d4.989e1502-e86e-4de5-a0b5-ea5a52a32533","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1778.13510798886905875.c774c592-fe72-4818-8ea0-81b1135821e9.99e1b8bd-e0e1-4f17-b052-ba15b82ef725","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9150.13510798886905875.c531bf1b-d613-45f2-b0b0-8013d6ac8011.0b275bfa-e300-410b-b502-e3a276f9d4c2","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14516.13510798886905875.07d59be9-c248-4a5a-ae19-0b42364a8108.9658e2f2-b90a-4138-b42c-a3c1c081cd00","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54959.13510798886905875.924e6a63-86b7-4640-9fcc-374c31b1defa.97b3121e-6d10-4cbc-8dd2-d1547794dda9","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.7,"RatingsCount":"3","PackageFamilyNames":["828B5831.SurvivorstheQuest_ytsefhwckbdv6"],"ContentIds":["b6f86d1a-d062-5b14-cb7f-f10a130f2952","03383660-a3fa-f5e6-dc1d-e2ea35bdfd31","24707859-4b6d-4d51-d7ba-c1d5ee63407e"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Can you survive long enough to discover the island’s secrets?\r\n\r\nCraft tools, explore ruins, and gather important resources to help keep your team alive.

Use your cunning to kill or tame the primeval creatures roaming the land, and encounter other players to survive, dominate... and escape! \r\n\r\nTAME, TRAIN, BREED & RIDE DINOSAURS, IN A LIVING ECOSYSTEM\r\nOver 50 creatures can be tamed using a challenging subdue-&-protect process. Weaken a feral creature to knock it out, and then nursing it to health. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your Pet, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Pets continue to level-up and consume food, and carry Inventory and Equipment.  Fly a Pteranodon over the mountains, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, or chase down prey on a T-Rex! Experience a dynamic ecosystem with its own predator & prey hierarchies. Breed Pets through successive generations to generate the best traits. Or put more simply, breed & raise Dino Babies!\r\n\r\nFOOD, WATER, TEMPERATURE AND WEATHER\r\nEat and drink to survive, with different foods having different nutritional values (including human meat!). All actions drain food and water, and long-distance travel is draining. Inventory weight slows you down, and the day/night cycle and weather alter the environment. Craft clothing, build shelter, and use fire to protect yourself against damage & the elements.\r\n\r\nHARVEST, CRAFT, AND PAINT ITEMS\r\nHarvest trees, ore, and more to become a master crafter. Use your hands, a Smithy, or a Fabricator to craft increasingly complex and powerful gear. Build a massive base using modular pieces--ranging from Thatch, to Wood, to Stone, to Metal. Customize your base by painting it and placing signs that you can actually draw on. Weapons, clothing, & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\r\n\r\nSUMMON THE ULTIMATE LIFE FORMS\r\nBring rare items to special Summon locations to awaken the ARK’s mythical creatures, who arrive ready for battle. These monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced Tribes and their Pets, and yield valuable items if they are defeated.\r\n\r\nRPG STATISTICS\r\nLevel-Up your survivor by gaining experience through in-game actions to learn new crafting Engrams, or find higher level item Blueprints in the most dangerous parts of the ARK. Customize the look of your character with a complex character creation system.\r\n\r\nHARDCORE MECHANICS\r\nItems have durability and wear out with use if not repaired. When you leave the game, your character remains “sleeping” in the persistent world. Your inventory also exists in the persistent world, vulnerable to theft. Death means permanent loss, and you can even enslave other players for your own purposes.\r\n\r\nLARGE WORLD PERSISTENCE\r\nOn the 70+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your pets stay in-game even when you leave. Special themed events will occur in the world with corresponding limited-run items!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PHKXB8RDKBC","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Forza Horizon 4 Deluxe Edition","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.913.14229724971193324.2000000000007864630.71ab5641-11af-4813-89d6-5176f4cb173d","Height":2160,"Width":2160,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61966.14229724971193324.2000000000007864596.5efc00e9-f8fa-48a3-89a2-60e31be565f4","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$79.99⁺","Price":79.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":[""],"ContentIds":[],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Dynamic seasons change everything at the world’s greatest automotive festival.
