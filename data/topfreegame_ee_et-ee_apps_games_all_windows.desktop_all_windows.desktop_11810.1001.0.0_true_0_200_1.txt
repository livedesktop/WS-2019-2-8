Prove it!\r\n\r\nThe faster you go, the more amazing your tricks will be.\r\n\r\nWhy is Stickman hook so perfect?\r\n- Because you can swing like a spider\r\n- Because your stickman dances at the end of each game (We challenge you to reproduce his dance)\r\n- Because there is a grappling hook (and grapples are cool, right?)\r\n\r\nYou LOVE Stickman Hook?","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NM8X8VK7QNC","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Dig Out!","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17783.13692132666833076.3d9709c5-c1ab-44fa-ad20-7aea798def43.db558b41-f301-4e4e-9545-97c916612e32","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#00BBEA","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53061.13692132666833076.3d9709c5-c1ab-44fa-ad20-7aea798def43.102c5e1e-891c-4236-a8ab-7dc54f916cfe","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#00BBEA","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15208.13692132666833076.3d9709c5-c1ab-44fa-ad20-7aea798def43.68ce99d4-7c38-4bba-9709-99433e790b50","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#00BBEA","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19116.13692132666833076.ace5e07c-3ec7-4810-8081-a094bc30294c.cfb8c97e-e076-4550-bce2-56d1cf6df9d6","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64238.13692132666833076.ed6e482d-711e-499f-9a45-427eb6668db0.17481b0f-fb8c-4652-9163-a4beae000544","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27542.13692132666833076.ed6e482d-711e-499f-9a45-427eb6668db0.94522b12-c043-4805-b937-de56db6ad25a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#00BBEA","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Tasuta⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["XIMADINC.DigOut_np8fj6akx2czy"],"ContentIds":["7060a299-e6c0-901a-b655-90ac22f7c27f","646f2066-5104-4df4-6d07-93cb3d7dc93d"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC-arvuti","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The mines are not going to dig themselves!\r\n\r\nGrab a pickaxe, a fresh pair of shoes and start diggin'!\r\n\r\nDig as deep as you can to collect shiny gems and treasures!

The computer game was originally created by Brodie Lockard in 1981 and named Mah-Jongg after the game that uses the same tiles for play. Lockard claims that it was based on a centuries-old Chinese game called \"the Turtle\". However, it was not until Activision released Shanghai in 1986 for the Macintosh and Apple IIgs that the game gathered momentum. A version of this game was also included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows 3.x in 1990 and went by the name Taipei. It was subsequently included in the Best of Windows Entertainment Pack. Premium editions of the Windows Vista operating system and Windows 7 include a version of the game known as Mahjong Titans. \r\nAs any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with 60 different layouts in a tiny download package. \r\nA tile that can be moved left or right without disturbing other tiles is said to be exposed. Exposed pairs of identical tiles (Flower and Seasons tiles in the same group being considered identical) are removed from the layout one at a time, gradually exposing the lower layers to play. The aim of the game is to clear the layout by pairing up all the tiles. The game is finished when either the layout is empty, or there are no exposed pairs remaining.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDNB8X","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"*Mine Sweeper","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15312.9007199266466131.661d4b0e-803c-49e7-b98f-0b5013de50c0.d8362def-9d03-4ab5-98eb-feeb0caa2091","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61468.9007199266466131.661d4b0e-803c-49e7-b98f-0b5013de50c0.679cdeb7-d869-466a-8844-fe2829a2347a","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Tasuta","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["12291raymond.li.MineSweeper_szs6zaftcmqhc"],"ContentIds":["c7718f4d-5f26-212c-a165-8f3140fbc8fb","85580725-5af9-c764-de39-c2c8391f35a8","e5a7a738-b019-19fa-855e-e5591ad61a60"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC-arvuti","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"*MineSweeper is a deceptively simple test of memory and reasoning—and one of the most popular windows games of all time.

The 28 domino tiles are shuffled face down and form the stock or boneyard. Each player draws seven tiles; the remainder are not used. Once the players begin drawing tiles, they are typically placed on-edge before the players, so that each player can see his own domino tiles, but none can see the value of other players' tiles. Every player can thus see how many tiles remain in the other players' hands at all times during gameplay. One player begins by downing (playing the first tile) one of their tiles. In different games first tiles are also different. In Muggins player should start with the highest double (6-6), in Bergen the first move should be 0-0, in Mexican train each round starts with the next lower double. This tile starts the line of play, a series of tiles in which adjacent tiles touch with matching, i.e. equal, values. The players alternately extend the line of play with one tile at one of its two ends. The game ends when one player wins by playing their last tile, or when the game is blocked because neither player can play. If that occurs, whoever caused the block gets all of the remaining player points not counting their own.\r\n- Scoring game\r\nPlayers accrue points during game play for certain configurations, moves, or emptying one's hand. Most scoring games use variations of the draw game. In Muggins (All fives) player must make the open ends of the layout add up to 5s or a multiple of five (5s, 10, 15, 20, etc.) In bergen player scores when numbers on the open ends are equal. If a player does not call \"domino\" before the tile is laid on the table, and another player says 'domino' after the tile is laid, the first player must pick up an extra domino. In Mexican train the double zero domino is scored as 50 points.\r\n- Draw game\r\nIn a draw game (blocking or scoring), players are additionally allowed to draw as many tiles as desired from the stock before playing a tile. The score of a game is the number of pips in the losing player's hand plus the number of pips in the stock. Most rules prescribe that two tiles need to remain in the stock. The Draw game is often referred to as simply \"dominos\".\r\n\r\nIf you like board games like Checkers, Mahjong, Backgammon and Chess, you will love Dominoes: Best Classic Dominoes Board Game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MT5VKKJW1DN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Hill Racing Go","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54085.13814377264154287.29e457bd-2622-4605-91d6-6f6940c5e8b1.e482c936-f8a8-4752-9cdd-63133197b72b","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57475.13814377264154287.a611dd50-804e-438e-b6b8-1f4a8b3ca8e4.1f966914-fb2a-4c54-8b99-26c21b3f2361","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Tasuta⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":1.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["7340AddictingGames.HillRacingGo_qrq33afaxz7vt"],"ContentIds":["2af26b28-0d7f-c6d3-567b-2c1a229a53fb","dd664f87-3afe-9b40-25be-2ed0df8915a6"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC-arvuti,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Play the most addictive physics-based car & bike racing game.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Control your car or bike to climb hills with most realistic control\r\n- Various cars and bikes to choose from\r\n- Upgrade ENGINE, TIRE, SUSPENSION, ROTATION, GAS POWER, 4WD, etc. for your cars and bikes.\r\n- 40+ challenging levels\r\n- 6 infinite maps to play repeatedly with your cars and bikes\r\n- different scenes in countryside, forest, volcano, desert, mountain and cave\r\n\r\nStart the hill climb racing game now!\r\nGame Genres: climbing games, car games, extreme road trip, driving games, offroad games","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MTW9LBXZ72S","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Puppet Soccer Football 17","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53865.13804643704815727.e3c125ca-25e3-4c20-a16b-b933c0cb79b4.0f0e7e17-dfa5-411b-bb87-5c025b1bb958","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53874.13804643704815727.ec11b630-7cda-44e4-9409-461303b610ef.90c6858e-f151-4058-9dc4-970d9083352f","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Tasuta","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":2.0,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["21824TapFunGames.SoccerFootballLeague17_2cqc67e0wqwzw"],"ContentIds":["63fa5e9c-aad7-81a7-7b03-ccbc531ad63e","66d0621b-6bdb-34d0-e68e-8bfd5750fceb","9a26c7a2-3c90-5623-7290-1f57879bfc79"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC-arvuti","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Playing football has never been more exciting than in the new Soccer Football League!

The powerful domain of the kingdom attracts enemies of all kinds, each more dangerous and devastating to the realm's armies than the last. \r\n\r\nThe king's reign has been threatened, and his personal sorcerer believes he has come up with a way to pull on ancient magic to ensure protection of castle and king, but something terrible and unexpected occurred during the spell and now a dark and mysterious force now looms large over the lands. It is only a matter of time before the day of reckoning descends over the nations and heralds the realms to a new age and dominate empire. \r\n\r\nCenturies of Feuding...\r\nThey'd inherited the feud from their fathers and couldn't recall the original cause. Perhaps they knew not who started it or why, but they certainly knew who would end it and how.

The spell was complete. The Druid Warlord of legend was born, and he was ready to go to war for the people of Komkaria. The Warlord lurched upright, and the glint of a candlelight flashed off his blade as it swung viciously through the air. \"Traitor!\" the Warlord growled. As the blade found its mark, and the blood gurgled up in the throat of the magician, he realized the one fatal flaw in his spell...\r\n\r\nGive it Your Best Shot...\r\nFight your way against dozens of ultimate foes as you guard the mighty powers of this impressive temple of war. The forceful soul of the guardian spirit is potent within these walls, but whose side does he champion?

The coins are also used to restore lives and buy rum for the sailors in order to open new episodes.\r\nCollect treasures, compete with your friends and become a real pirate!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGGZMC4D","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Snowboard Party Lite","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8573.13510798883381455.5a485c19-0272-4516-a4c6-8c8580b0a864.217d9c9b-b4cd-477d-9f2b-0c6fdf7f6708","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60170.13510798883381455.ce3c877e-f8b0-4680-8b2b-296565887374.c2907c45-a299-4938-93be-da321d433e1f","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34735.13510798883381455.2a2935ae-6abb-4ddf-8624-91e193155a87.a96ba0fe-4f23-4151-82e4-d552baff0da1","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57690.13510798883381455.89e8fd53-bf70-4fc7-bf6b-fede74217a1c.cc4b50e3-d407-455c-b8f5-6cbf3f4e0ced","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59680.13510798883381455.a36eeea1-7e1f-4219-a4fe-956e67de0bff.fc1b9d1d-9d50-4256-b722-07f18222c964","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43510.13510798883381455.9cc043c7-eb78-4544-a977-f7d9fc88c85b.07b8c95a-92d4-4e89-98b0-f09615c51221","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33335.13510798883381455.4ad418b1-7960-4a9f-8b98-fc0e4b3dee5f.b7ef3de2-9182-4a53-8033-fa2dfec0795d","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.67.13510798883381455.980516f0-740c-4876-aa61-0e30905b4911.be88fd73-410d-4a6c-b00d-7532673e305f","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6525.13510798883381455.e6c9d8d6-a254-4709-b66b-7b84fe62aafa.5c2254b3-f519-4c16-bfe5-938f2cd0d8e3","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54660.13510798883381455.068bf038-068c-4e98-9631-3cb3defefa88.091bd83e-e2e4-4e9a-b360-ece348f20a5b","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Tasuta⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.3,"RatingsCount":"3","PackageFamilyNames":["F223684A.SnowboardPartyLite_0ecc88g07fveg"],"ContentIds":["0ad62263-e992-3532-cfb5-3321e0fa27af","7023d138-f805-c3f5-dd44-7217aa76c188","1fc18c78-1acc-4d0d-e065-3e2bc9e66895"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC-arvuti,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Snowboard Party brings the thrill of snowboarding to your mobile device!

Whilst simple in concept a good deal of strategy is required to complete the layouts.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the game is to remove all the tiles from a layout in the least possible time. Layouts can vary in pattern, size and shape. Tiles are removed in pairs and may only be removed if they are both free and match one another. Free tiles are ones that have no other piece touching the left, right or both sides and no tiles on top.\r\n\r\nWhilst all deals generated by Mahjongg are solvable you will need to remove pairs of tiles carefully to ensure you don’t stop the removal of remaining pairs. \r\n\r\nThis game is ad-funded.

A crime syndicate that operates in deep secrecy to steal the most valuable items around the world.\r\nAre you ready for a life of crime? Become our new recruit and download this action-packed stealth game now!\r\n\r\nJust some of the awesome features:\r\n⛬ Unique stealth play\r\nDynamics shadows and lights offering unique stealth experience\r\n⛬ Many cool gadgets to unlock\r\n ⚬ Night vision goggle\r\n ⚬ Thermal (heat) goggles\r\n ⚬ Stun gun\r\n ⚬ Electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapons\r\n ⚬ Digital map\r\n ⚬ so much more to come\r\n⛬ Take-downs\r\nNeutralize guards and drag them out of sight\r\n⛬ Multiple campaigns with many missions\r\nSteal priceless items around the world in a full career-mode\r\n⛬ Control the environment\r\nDestroy lights, eliminate security cams\r\n\r\nThe art of stealth\r\nYou will need to operate in complete silence and remain undetected as you steal objects from the most secure locations. Avoid or neutralize guards, sneak past security cameras, and maneuver past anti-theft security laser pointer systems. It's all part of your daily occupation as a notorious thief.\r\n\r\nThe key to completing successful missions in this stealth game is remaining undetected. Use the shadows and any tiny corner to your advantage. You often have multiple options to a situation, will you take-down a guards or will you simply sneak by. While missions can be completed whilst detected, the true art of stealth is to achieve 100% stealth scores for your missions.\r\n\r\nGame-play TIPS\r\n1. Use the dark shadows\r\nWatch your stealth visibility indicator at the bottom/right of the screen closely to see how visible you are. By staying in the dark shadows you will remain invisible to the guards and this allows you to sneak past them undetected.\r\n2. Use gadgets wisely\r\nAs you complete missions you're arsenal of gadgets and gear expands, but your resources remain limited. Use your ammunition wisely throughout the missions as you may come cross critical situations when you will desperately need your weapons.\r\n3. Drag guards into the shadow\r\nTo avoid any later detection of knocked out guards you need to be sure to drag them out of sight into a dark corner or behind cover. Detection of a guards leads to the alarm being raised and will negatively impact your stealth % score.\r\n4. Be patient\r\nThey key to any stealth game is to be patient and observe the situation and then take measured and planning action accordingly.\r\n\r\nYour gadgets\r\nComplete missions and you will be rewarded by the syndicate with new high-tech gadgets allowing you to complete the most challenging heists against all odds. Pay close attention to the gadget training missions.\r\n\r\nThe jobs\r\nThis stealth game presents a simulation of the life of a pro modern criminal.

But the more you delve into this secluded island and the twisted family relations of the owners, the more complicated and unclear this case becomes.\r\n\r\nTRY IT FREE, THEN UNLOCK THE FULL ADVENTURE FROM WITHIN THE GAME!\r\n\r\nA rookie inspector on her first assignment and her experienced copartner arrive at the scene – a luxurious island in the middle of the ocean owned by a young millionaire, who wants the matter concluded as quietly as possible. The question in this case appears simple enough:  was a security guard's death a suicidal plunge, or maybe an unfortunate fall? \r\nThe residents of the island - the Bradford family - at first seem cordial and beyond reproach, even shocked by the death of a friendly employee. But upon closer inspection it becomes clear that they harbor animosities and deep hidden motives.
