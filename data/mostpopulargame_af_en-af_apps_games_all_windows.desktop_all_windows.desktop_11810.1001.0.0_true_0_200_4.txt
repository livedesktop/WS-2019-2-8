So, yep we mastered AI along time ago!\r\n\r\nRegardless of your playing level, ZingMagic's multi award winning Chess is a fun, stimulating and challenging game for beginners and champions alike.\r\n\r\nChess is a two player game with a colourful history which can be traced back to its Indian ancestor, Chaturanga. In 1291 the Archbishop of Canterbury in England threatened clergy who continued playing Chess with a diet of bread and water.  \r\nThe game has flourished over the years and is now one of the most popular board games in the world, requiring thought, skill and strategy to become successful.\r\n\r\nThe object of Chess is to capture the opponent's King.  To capture the King you must place it in check.  If the King cannot escape by itself, or with the help of its army, it is in checkmate and the King is captured.\r\n \r\nZingMagic’s multi award winning Chess application supports over 20 levels of play allowing you to play moves or games against the clock or relax and play at your own pace. Whatever level of Chess you choose, you can be sure that ZingMagic’s Chess will give you a fun, stimulating and challenging game.\r\n\r\nThis game is ad-funded.

The jet-set gameplay will be epic as you race around the world to visit the world’s most exciting places and buy locations.\r\n\r\nOnopoly is also known popularly called Business Board Game, The Landlord's Game and Finance\r\n\r\nOnopoly is a great game for 2 - 6 players. It is a board game where players roll two six-sided dice to move around the game board, buying and trading properties, and develop them with houses and hotels. Players collect rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them into bankruptcy. \r\n\r\nMoney can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards, and tax squares; players can end up in jail, which they cannot move from until they have met one of several conditions. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.\r\n\r\nPlay against the computer, against your friends in Local mode or with Thousands of Onopoly players around the world in Online Multiplayer Mode.\r\n\r\nYou can also create Private Rooms and invite your friends to play in Play with Friends Mode.\r\n\r\nOnopoly is a simple game: you start off with some money, and your goal is to be the last player standing with money. The way you win in Monopoly is by collecting rents on property, or cash flow.\r\n\r\nOnopoly brilliantly combines both strategy and chance.

In fact, at first glance you might think of it as a bit of a joke. I mean seriously, no graphics or sound at all? What kind of game is that? Long before quality graphics and sound was available on game systems, there were playable stories. Some have called them ‘Interactive Fiction’, others ‘Text Adventure Games’. Instead of using the machine’s graphic and sound capabilities, they used the player’s imagination. This game has been specifically designed to reignite that lost game genre while implementing a modern interface that makes for a surprisingly refreshing gaming experience.\r\n\r\nThis Christian themed story begins with an accident. An accident that leaves you, as the player, unable to recall not only where you are, but who you are as well. Awakening in an overturned van, being suspended by your seatbelt, you must first figure a way of escape. Once free to explore the area, you find yourself in a world that not only seems strangely empty, but openly hostile as well. As the story unfolds and your memory begins to return, you begin to question whether these strange happenings are limited to the immediate area. If your experience of this small town is reflective of the state of the world, then things are certainly not as they used to be!\r\n\r\nA word of warning! This seemingly dark tale is refreshed by a large number of humorous responses that if caught unaware, may have you bursting out in spontaneous laughter. This may cause embarrassment if played in a public place. In fact, no matter how many hours are spent playing this game, it would be nearly impossible to discover every comical response.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ1LV","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Cricket 3D World Street Challenge","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41935.9007199266244237.5818d65e-20b9-4ef8-9b03-260b26c1f348.3654212a-edc0-42cf-aa02-762e8b9a02eb","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#F2F5A9","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39839.9007199266244237.5e0d85a0-ba41-4d45-af73-9a9bf8aa6366.4d9ed70d-58cc-4fe2-9c7c-43c466f8c0e2","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#F2F5A9","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["DumaduGamesPvtLtd.Cricket3DWorldStreetChallenge_19bhvy30nxe8w"],"ContentIds":["17967510-c97f-103e-31ec-f36053500510","af863a5e-1f0c-8978-dc33-04a95325d9eb"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Grab the helmet, tighten those pads and pull up your socks for some deadly strokes and shots in this Cricket 3D - World Street Cricket game!

How? You blow at them with more bubbles, and when three or more of the same color come together, they all explode. Just tap at where you want the next bubble to go.\r\nThe more bubbles blow up at one tap, the increasingly more points you gain (six ones at one tap is better tan two three-bubble taps). Besides, those bubbles that fell apart from the rest will explode too. It is well worth trying to arrange such avalanches, as they will give you ten times more points than ordinary bursts.\r\nAnother important rule to know is that the borders are like mirrors. If you shoot a bubble towards an exposed border, it will not stick to the border but will bounce right back like a stream of light against a mirror. This feature becomes really handful when the center of your board is filled up with and you need to shoot some bubbles on the sidebars.\r\nIf your tap fails to detonate any bubbles, you get a foul, and when there are several fouls, one or two new line of bubbles appears at the top. The number of misfires allowed before bubbles will advance again, is shown by the number of silver ball in the left bottom corner.\r\nThe game is over when you clean all the bubbles off and your score doubles, or bubbles move all the way down on you.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH10R6T","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Horse Racing 3D (Kids Edition)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24639.13510798882279742.a1fd3a53-0487-4daf-a22e-8112df695e9a.2eda064d-3c61-4521-9394-f08fa0c26467","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61321.13510798882279742.baad310b-0188-482c-aa9a-371b8e394dd3.5c1ee3c2-9c63-4014-8456-5cabb6fe1994","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["YASHFUTURETECHSOLUTIONSPV.HorseRacing3DKidsEdition_rs8r5b65h5hnj"],"ContentIds":["5b8ba334-5ab5-4acd-036a-9aa3259e0c6b","6f92d733-dc8b-14ed-cab9-1e71b4004865"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Horse Racing 3D (Kids Edition) is Amazing 3D Pony Horse Racing game for everyone.

An early variant of Tic-tac-toe was played in Roman Empire, around the first century BC. It was called Terni Lapilli and instead of having any number of pieces, each player only had three, thus they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing. The game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Rome. However, there is some evidence to suggest that Tic-Tac-Toe could originate back to ancient Egypt. \r\nThe different names of the game are more recent. The first print reference to \"noughts and crosses\", the British name, appeared in 1864. The first print reference to a game called \"tick-tack-toe\" occurred in 1884, but referred to \"a children's game played on a slate, consisting in trying with the eyes shut to bring the pencil down on one of the numbers of a set, the number hit being scored\". \"Tic-tac-toe\" may also derive from \"tick-tack\", the name of an old version of backgammon first described in 1558. The U.S. renaming of noughts and crosses as tic-tac-toe occurred in the 20th century. \r\nWhen playing against a phone, human player is always 'O'. The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. Using menu button, game can be configured to play on the larger boards to connect 4 pieces, or between 2 people.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFHX0X","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Big Buck Hunter","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12643.9007199266247203.ee875b0d-1ec0-4c34-b34a-d3496b8a11cc.2f699711-6b46-4b47-8a44-069e9d7a79f0","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#2f9c39","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.443.9007199266247203.cfadcb23-0972-4226-be0c-1905ee94b848.148cb130-46a8-4963-9f99-0a31327fd2bc","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#2f9c39","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$4.99","Price":4.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["Microsoft.BigBuckHunter_8wekyb3d8bbwe"],"ContentIds":["2b6cea54-983f-7ed2-4ca4-1d4de98de392"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Big Buck Hunter Pro Adventure brings the number one arcade hunting game to Windows 8 in a fresh new format.\r\n\r\nBig Buck Hunter Pro Adventure features the brand new Adventure Mode where players embark on their own custom hunting vacation across 18 different locations across North America.

Meet one of the most entertaining birds on the planet.  Our flappy friend lives on an abandoned amusement island, where you can find any of the coolest mini golf tracks (courses) on earth. My bird has a huge passion for mini golf but there are no golf clubs (sticks) and balls to play with, he has reinvented the game concept.\r\nHe blows up his clumsy body until he looks like a ball and uses a slingshot to move towards the hole.\r\nAfter the first shot the game play will change from slingshot modus to arrow modus with a power bar, for a more precise stroke.\r\nAdvice: Remember that the first hit will be the most difficult, so do not put too much strength in it because it will simply make our fluffy friend, fly out of the track. Don't hit the bird into the sea - it doesn't like to be a subsurfer...\r\n\r\nCool gamefeat:\r\n- Awesome 3D graphics\r\n- Cute animal characters and animations with dancing birds\r\n- 4 fun courses with over 70 holes\r\n- Simple, drag-and-release gameplay mechanic for the slingshot\r\n- Direction arrow with power bar for the successive stroke - just touch it\r\n- Realistic physics and ball movement\r\n- Collectible coins and jewels to increase your score\r\n- Easy and funny to play\r\n\r\nTry to find the shortest and easiest path to the hole in order to rise your score. Let's make it with no more than 3 par (hits) and you will get three stars.\r\nThere are also collectible coins and jewels that can increase your final score like crazy.\r\n\r\nIf you collect one gem you will get back one par (stroke) which means that you have higher possibilities to get 3 stars.\r\n\r\nEnjoy hours of fun with this challenging free app!
