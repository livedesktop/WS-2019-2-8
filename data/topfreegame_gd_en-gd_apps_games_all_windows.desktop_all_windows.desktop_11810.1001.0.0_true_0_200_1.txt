The deep snow in the winters has made it difficult for people to move around and tourists are also planning skiing trips and you have to transport the passengers and ski gear to offroad deep snow mountain tracks. Drive the snow tourist bus and pick n drop the passengers. You also have to pick the tourists from snowy hill resorts to city. Deep snow has made it very difficult & dangerous to drive on the narrow roads of the city and off road tracks have become even more risky. Make sure you don't hit the traffic and people on the road as it is really cold due to snow blizzards and the roads have become narrower. Snowy Bus Drive is a challenging game testing driving skills in risky and dangerous conditions and difficult paths. Hill drivers are really experts in cutting those hilly corners and curves but snow adds to the risk and challenge. Tourists in the mountain top resorts are depending for their survival on you so that they can reach the city safe and sound. Be the best snow bus driver on city and off-road conditions.\r\n\r\nUse the controls to accelerate and brake according to the conditions. Drive carefully and make sure you can see your way in the snow and control the bus on the skiddy ice. It is like a thin sheet of glass on the roads. Everything is covered in snow from the hill tops & mountain to roads to houses to hotels. The met department has reported that the snow storm is likely to keep at this pace for many days to come and people cannot use their cars to travel in this weather. Since you are one of the only few bus drivers providing the transport services in these tough hilly conditions on off-road and city roads, you have to be fast and rush to your destination to pick as many passengers as possible. People are depending upon you to reach their homes for Christmas and New Year. You are an expert snow driver who can make all this happen.\r\n\r\nYou have multiple game play missions in hilly off road conditions to complete so be ready for the kicks and excitement. Just launch into the game and drive away and you have to make sure you are driving safe. You will experience both city and off-road environment and view many scenic views of mountains and hills while you are driving in the snowy conditions. Drive the extreme snow bus drive away!\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy the game.

The soldier in this game has a story as well, except that it’s incomplete. The soldier begins to tell the tale, but does not end it.\r\n\r\nThis Game draw parallels to our familiar stories of 'One Thousand And One Nights', The Arabian Nights from the perspective of the soldier. Play this Game and Stretch your mind. Fast forward to the Past for Magic, Romance and History. The more you play, the more you will be amazed. Your victory is to capture all the magic and mystery that are the Arabian Nights.\r\n\r\nTHE STORY WITHIN A STORY:\r\nThe story is of a woman, Sharazad, who marries a King. The King's custom is to spend one night with a woman and execute her in the morning. To avoid this, Sharazad tells him tales of Ali Baba, Aladdin and Sinbad, but leaves part of it unfinished.The King, curious about how the story ends, is thus forced to postpone her execution in order to hear the conclusion. The next night, as soon as she finishes the tale, she begins and only begins a new one, and the King, eager to hear the conclusion, postpones her execution once again until the King finally spares her life. So it goes on for 1,001 nights, The Arabian Nights.\r\n\r\nSOLDIER TURNED WORRIER:\r\nThis is your journey to the past. You are the worrier of the ‘Arabian Nights’. You are a very different sort of Ali Baba, Aladdin and Sinbad. You are the Legend REBORN. You are an iconic figure in the King’s army and you are honored with the Medal of Courage. You are going to be called on to take care of the most nasty situations. The King realized that assault from the sea was always a commando like operation which required special training, bold leadership, and an aggressive spirit. You have gained a lot of the valuable combat experience in Arabian battles. You take on this legendary character of the soldier that turned into a worrier and have to finish the story. You can turn around the remaining story whenever you want.\r\n\r\nACTION PLAY:\r\n- This is a 6-Axis controls game in Full HD and 3D Graphics.\r\n- Your Weapon is the \"Six Pack\" Automatic Machine Gun.\r\n- Your Six Barreled MG can fire 4000 rounds of explosives per minute.\r\n- You have the support of Enemy Detecting Radar that helps you to navigate the battlefield.\r\n- The Doppler Radar figures out the distance at which your enemies are moving.\r\n- The Radar also uses Infrared Radiation patterns to point out the positions of the enemy troops.\r\n\r\nFor Windows Tablet:\r\n\r\n- You can move left, right, forward, reverse using the on screen touch pad.\r\n- The double touch feature provides 3D camera view in all directions.\r\n- You can touch and swipe your fingers of both hands at the same time for smooth rotations.\r\n- The Gun Fire Control System (GFCS) is shown on the lower right side of the touch screen.\r\n- You can use your right hand thumb to tap on the screen to fire the machine gun.\r\n\r\nFor Windows PC:\r\n\r\n- Use Mouse Cursor For Rotation \r\n- Use left Control Or Left Mouse button for auto fire\r\n- Use Arrow keys for movement\r\n\r\nYou Guys, Good Luck Tonight, And Remember Have Fun With It.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDL1SC","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Tales of Middleport","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8719.9007199266414088.58817be4-ec68-4a0f-adf6-e23402f11edb.d48a68ec-f77f-418c-93d4-bd8f7ca98191","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#2b4171","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1395.9007199266414088.a2b3452e-35c3-4664-8722-06f397e4a207.a1a333e7-0839-46eb-8a27-a6d8fc3ec57a","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#2b4171","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["GogiiGames.TalesofMiddleport_h0jt470c3ph82"],"ContentIds":["80d472c0-0d84-1d34-ce47-d080079cd82c"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"A darkness has fallen over the once-sleepy seaside town of Middleport, and townspeople are mysteriously disappearing at an alarming rate!

Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. \r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\n•Available in the following languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Chinese\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://driftmania2.com  \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com   \r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJCJR","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Fate of the Pharaoh","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32389.9007199266251700.0e4ba0df-5537-4387-921b-ba0cfbab38d3.9675d4cc-ef51-4d42-b244-5d9b54930cc1","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#185D94","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48570.9007199266251700.4153983c-052b-455a-8e03-6eb413bf3da5.35ceba5b-0c2d-42f8-a64f-95d178ad45e4","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#185D94","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64563.9007199266251700.f6bce5e4-9094-4eb5-8430-c75933d4cfb7.4ee5393a-4f17-42d5-905f-c6a8a3e77d9c","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2631.9007199266251700.f6bce5e4-9094-4eb5-8430-c75933d4cfb7.79b2545b-8b62-4778-b2fa-276b5de7b5eb","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13620.9007199266251700.f6bce5e4-9094-4eb5-8430-c75933d4cfb7.8f4d1fbe-acac-4720-b68f-00deb0e52f02","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#185D94","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["CateiaGames.FateofthePharaoh_mmwabm93ypyqr"],"ContentIds":["bb1eca3e-c711-b7ed-74b9-743df78debf6","0b4d1e5c-03f2-c7e7-5c8e-d9d267e5f20f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Build your glorious Egyptian towns and expand your realm in glory and prosper!\r\n\r\nConstruct your own mighty Egyptian empire and take control of the land in Fate of the Pharaoh!

10!\r\n\r\nSolitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day. Complete enough Daily Challenges in a month to earn badges and compete with your friends.\r\n\r\nStar Club\r\nEven more challenges arranged in collections and packs you can unlock by earning stars.\r\n\r\nChoose Your Theme\r\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection features several beautiful themes, from the simplicity of \"Classic\" to the serenity of an Aquarium that comes to life before you while you play. You can even create custom themes from your own photos!\r\n\r\nXbox Live Integration\r\nSign in with your Microsoft account to earn achievements, compete with your friends on the leaderboards, and track your personal gameplay statistics. If you sign in with a Microsoft account, your progress is stored in the cloud so you can play the game on any device without missing a beat!\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PLCN603222Z","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"PAC-MAN Battle","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15608.14319857347656806.25a98015-af7b-42ff-b611-30651e260f92.53d2f24a-ab81-4860-9bdc-8933adfc70a0","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1889.14319857347656806.454114e6-cfb9-49f9-a693-6515c062f47f.a177c6a1-15f7-4381-ba8b-a08001606390","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28674.14319857347656806.4f06725b-5679-45b3-a5d3-e8b2d79f6959.6441dd9f-c928-43d2-94de-0500c9dde2d8","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1889.14319857347656806.454114e6-cfb9-49f9-a693-6515c062f47f.a177c6a1-15f7-4381-ba8b-a08001606390","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["50867PocketKingGames.PAC-MANBattle_m8bdd0rdw5vr0"],"ContentIds":["02ab4a8b-737e-7c95-3d63-247fd4c849d5","5de77a24-15da-6343-0637-9b3160eeed1f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Enjoy everyone’s favorite classic arcade game, PAC-MAN, for FREE!\r\nEarn high scores as you eat fruit and run away from the Ghosts: Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde.
